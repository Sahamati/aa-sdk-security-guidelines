# AA SDK Security Guidelines

These security guidelines have to be implemented in the account aggregator (AA) ecosystem by AAs that offer SDKs as AA Clients, which can be embedded into third-party apps (such as FIU apps).

The AA SDK should be able to capture information securely without exposing the information captured to the embedding FIU app.


## Platform agnostic guidelines
1. The SDK should support only consent approval/rejection, sign-up/sign-in, discovery flow. The SDK can also include listing the consents, but only consents created by the respective FIU.
2. Traceability â€“ The AA should be able to trace the identity of the initiator of any API call made from the SDK to the AA.
3. SDK should authenticate itself with the AA for the AA to verify ownership of the SDK. 
4. The SDK should not expose any information related to user's account information like the accounts discovered and number of accounts discovered to the FIU or any other source.
5. If the host app is malicious then calls made from the SDK embedded in the host app should be rejected.
6. The UI built using the SDK should be certified by the AA, where necessary information of the consent is displayed. Similar to the information shown by AA's web portal. - rewording needed


Currently, the guidelines are available for Web and Android platforms.
